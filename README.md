# Obesity Data Visualization Project

## Overview

This project aims to visualize obesity rates and trends across various demographics in Canada using different types of charts and maps. The visualizations include bar charts, pie charts, scatterplots, heatmaps, and a choropleth map.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Install a local server environment like WampServer.
2. Place all project files in the appropriate directory (`www` for WampServer).
3. Open the web browser and navigate to the project directory.

## Description of Files

- `integrated.html`: Main page of the project with navigation links to different visualizations.
- `bar_chart.html`: Displays bar charts showing obesity rates across different age groups.
- `pie_chart.html`: Displays pie charts showing obesity rates across different genders.
- `scatterplot.html`: Shows a scatterplot representing obesity rates by age group and gender.
- `heatmap.html`: Displays a heatmap illustrating obesity rates across age and gender categories.
- `choroplethmap.html`: Shows a choropleth map representing obesity rates in Canadian provinces.
- `visualizations.html`: Page containing various visualizations of obesity data.
- `style.css`: Cascading Style Sheets file for styling the project.
- `obesity.jpg`: Image file used in the project for visual representation.

## Data Sources

- `open_gov_ca_age_sex.csv`: CSV file containing obesity data categorized by age group and gender.
- `canada.geojson`: GeoJSON file containing the geographical data of Canadian provinces.
- `obesity_by_province_data.csv`: Contains data on obesity rates by province.
- `2022_data.json`: Provides additional data used in the pie chart visualization.

## Technologies Used

- **D3.js**: JavaScript library used for creating interactive data visualizations.
- **HTML/CSS**: Markup and styling languages used for structuring and designing web pages.
- **WampServer**: Local server environment used for hosting and running the project.

## Usage

- Click on the navigation links in `integrated.html` to explore different visualizations.
- Interact with the visualizations to view detailed information about obesity rates and trends.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement additional visualizations or refine existing ones based on user feedback.
- Integrate more interactive features to enhance user engagement and exploration.
